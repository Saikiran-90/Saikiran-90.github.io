<p>Shivaji was born in the hill-fort of Shivneri, near the city of Junnar, 
  which is now in Pune district. Scholars disagree on his date of birth. 
  The Government of Maharashtra lists 19 February as a holiday commemorating 
  Shivaji's birth (Shivaji Jayanti).[a][16][17] Shivaji was named after a local deity, 
  the goddess Shivai.[18][19] Shivaji's father Shahaji Bhonsle was a Maratha general who served the 
  Deccan Sultanates.His mother was Jijabai the daughter of Lakhuji Jadhavrao of Sindhkhed, 
  a Mughal-aligned sardar claiming descent from a Yadav royal family of Devagiri.[21][22]

Shivaji belonged to Maratha family of Bhonsle clan.[23] His paternal 
  grandfather Maloji (1552–1597) was an influential general of Ahmadnagar Sultanate, 
  and was awarded the epithet of "Raja". He was given deshmukhi rights of Pune, Supe, 
  Chakan and Indapur for military expenses. He was also given Fort Shivneri for his family's residence (c. 1590).[24][25]

At the time of Shivaji's birth, power in the Deccan was shared by three Islamic sultanates: 
  Bijapur, Ahmednagar, and Golkonda. Shahaji often changed his loyalty between the Nizamshahi 
  of Ahmadnagar, the Adilshah of Bijapur and the Mughals, but always kept his jagir (fiefdom) at Pune and his small arm</p>
